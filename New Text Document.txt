A database automatically should give Ids to its entries 
Ids should not be created manually
POSTGRES should give unique Ids to each entry automatically,to do so we use BIGSERIAL 
datatype on ids, BIGSERIAL is a kind of big integer so, whenever, there will be new entry
it will increment it by 1. It also makes sure that each entry in the database is unique

NOT NULL - to ensure that each column has not a null entry, each column should have value

dotenv is the package to manage the environment variables

normally an api sends the data back in json format

### Express Middleware
First the request comes to  the express middleware, there could be multiple middlewares
, then the request finally goes to the route handlers. The route handlers execute the request.
The request first processed in the middlewares. The middlewares transfer the request 
to route handler via 'next' object. So it is necessary to pass the 'next' object
in the initial middlewares so that the next object can transfer the request to 
the next middlewares/route handlers.
The middlewares should be before the routes/ route handlers and after the express 
app initialization
With the middleware we can send the response back to the user

We will be using morgan middleware. Morgan is a logger middlware
Morgan is a third party middleware
Why are we using middleware? What problem are we trying to solve?
So when we create the restaurant, we pass the data in the request body,
but we should also know how to retrieve the data from the body and the way we do that
is we use the built in middleware that comes with express which is called  express.json
So the middleware 'express.json()', so when we send the request, it is going to take the 
request body information and it is going to attach to the request object and it is going
to attach it under the property called 'body'

To connect node to postgres, use node-postgres library(node-postgres.com)
// importing pg library, but we care about only pool so importing pool from pg
const { Pool } = require("pg");
// we are creating a new pool, this is actually what is going to connect to our databse 
const pool = new Pool();
// we are exporting the pool and the query object
module.exports  = {
    query : (text, params) => pool.query(text, params),
};

we do async and await on route handlers because if we don't do that, the response will be
a promise.
Whenever you are using async await, you need to wrap it in try catch block
